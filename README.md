# Big Mamma Pizzaria

First project of this group. The project management is located on ClickUp.

### Principles
For someone it can be a little bit frustrating in the beginning to work with GitHub, but there are some principles that we should follow to be the most efficient and clean.

I'm mainly talking about keeping the main branch clean. So everyone is working on his own branch and we are making post request to the main branch, which has to be reviewed by at least one group member.

It's not really case for this project, because this is really small one. But it can be good practice for Mo to learn it. 

## Last and the most important
Life is not just all about money, remember that.
